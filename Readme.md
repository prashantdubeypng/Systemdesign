# System Design Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning System Design. It serves as a collection of resources, code examples, and notes covering various aspects of designing scalable and maintainable software systems.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and understand core system design concepts, starting from low-level object-oriented design principles to high-level architectural patterns.

## Content Structure

### SolidPrinciples
This directory contains Java code examples demonstrating the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

- Single Responsibility Principle: Code showing how to separate concerns into distinct classes.
- Open/Closed Principle: Examples of designing classes that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Implementation showing how subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

## Future Topics

- Design Patterns
- High-Level Architecture (Load Balancing, Caching, Database Partitioning)
- System Design Case Studies

## Resources

(This section will be updated with links to books, articles, and courses used during the learning process.)
